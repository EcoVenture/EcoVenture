      <h2>Why Should You Help?</h2>
      <p>There are so many things happening around the world that affect the environment everyday. Issues such as pollution, food wastage, and deforestation are just a few of the many ways that the environment is harmed. As these issues continue on they can badly affect our world in the future.<br><br>
You many not know this but some of your everyday activities and tasks have a huge affect on the Earth and sometimes harm it. For example, more than half of air pollution in the US is caused from automobiles. This means that the cars that you ride or drive in emit harmful fumes that pollute the environment. Another factor that contributes to pollution is the trash we throw away. Even though most of our trash waste going to landfills or recycling, a majority of it ends up spreading itself around the globe, either by being transported by wind, water or humans. Apart from pollution, deforestation is another big problem we have that is a major contributor to hurting the environment Many of the worldâ€™s most threatened and endangered animals live in forests, and 1.6 billion people rely on benefits that forests offer, including food, fresh water, clothing, traditional medicine and shelter but many of the trees in the forest are getting cut and being used for other purposes, taking away habitats and needs from many.
