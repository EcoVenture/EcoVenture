      <h1>About Code Green</h1>
      <p>Hello everybody! We are Code Green, the developers of EcoVenture. We are participants the 2017 Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at IBM Austin. Throughout this seven-week intensive coding camp,
        we have learned a lot of coding skills that can be seen in EcoVenture, our final project.<br>
        As a team, all five of us are very passionate about raising awareness about environmental issues. Additionally, we all enjoy gaming and Computer Science. The way we combined both of our passions, was through EcoVenture, a game for elementary and middle school children, where they can learn about the importance of protecting the environment and what actions they can take to better it.
